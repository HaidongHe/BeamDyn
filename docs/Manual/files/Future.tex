\label{sec:FutureWork}
The following list contains future work on BeamDyn software:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Eliminating numerical problems in single precision.
    \item Implementing eigenvalue analysis.
    \item Improving input options for stand-alone version to make it more user-friendly.
    \item Implementing GEBT based on modal method  for computational efficiency.
    \item Adding more options for blade cross-sectional properties inputs.
    \item Writing a general guidance on modeling composite beam structures using BeamDyn.
    \item Extending applications in FAST to other slender structures in the wind turbine system, for example, tower, mooring lines, and shaft.
    \item Developing a simplified form of GEBT with only rotational DOFs (bending, torsion) for computational efficiency.
\end{itemize}
