\chapter{Future Work}
The following list contains future work on BeamDyn software:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing eigenvalue analysis.
    \item Improving definition of inputs for stand-alone version to make it more user-friendly.
    \item Implementing GEBT based on modal method.
    \item Adding more options for blade cross-sectional properties inputs.
    \item Writing a general guidance on modeling composite beam structures using BeamDyn.
    \item Extending applications to other slender structures in the wind turbine system, for example, tower, mooring lines, and shaft.
\end{itemize}
