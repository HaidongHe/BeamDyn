BeamDyn Change Log

================================================================================
v1.01.04 26-Jul-2016
- added the full finite-element mass and stiffness matrices of the blade model at time zero to the summary file
- fixed a problem in BeamDyn whereby its velocities were initialized incorrectly when ElastoDyn was initialized
  with nonzero deflections/displacements

================================================================================
v1.01.03 12-Apr-2016
- modified validity check to use single-precision variables

================================================================================
v1.01.02 5-Apr-2016

- fixed a bug that would use the wrong node numbers in gaussian quadrature
- fixed some initialization problems and type conversions reported/fixed by Johannes Rieke
- incorporated some changes by Johannes Rieke (precision differences so driver can be compiled in single precision, too;
  moved some subroutines from Driver_Beam.f90 to Driver_Beam_Subs.f90)
- fixed makefile so it will compile the sources distributed in archive
- fixed problem in initial configuration (At0 E10) whereby an initially curved beam induces strain and motion.
- updated "xb", "yb" and "zb" text on key point coordinates in input files to match "xr", "yr", "zr" in documentation

- added the MiscVar type (split from OtherStates) to conform to changes to FAST framework
- updated comments to doxygen style
- moved the section of CalcOutput that computes the displacements and velocities for the BldMotion mesh into a subroutine.
  explicitly initialized BD output mesh with this subroutine due to coupling with AD in option 2 solve in FAST.
  This allows AeroDyn to have a better initial guess.
- reworked some subroutine arguments so that we send parameter and MiscVar types instead of individual components of those types.
  moved some of the local variables that were allocated each time step into the miscVar type. This has sped up FAST's Test 26 2-5%.
- removed a few variables the compiler marked as unused
- added validity checks on mass matrix, M, from input file: M(1,1)=M(2,2)=M(3,3) and M(4,4)+M(5,5)=M(6,6) (in input file coordinates) for each input station
- added validity check that kp_zr(1) must be zero.
- added BD_STATIC_ANALYSIS and BD_DYNAMIC_ANALYSIS constants for check (in FAST) that static analysis isn't used when coupled to FAST
- added text to indicate mapping of element/node number to global node number in summary file
- updated the manual
