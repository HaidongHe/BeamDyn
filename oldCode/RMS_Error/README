Files:

rms_error.f:  calculates the normalized RMS error of a history in the file
Test.dat against a benchmark history in the file Bench.dat.  First line of
these files should be '#' followed by the number of data in the file, e.g,

# 10
0. 0.
0.1 14.
etc

data is stored as time, value

generate_test_data.f: generates test files Bench.dat and Test.dat.
Bench.dat is data for sin(t) over 0 <= t <= 10.  Test Data is for
sin(1.1*t) over the same interval.   The exact normalized error of this is 
0.6068828437420661, which was calculate with mathematica

verification_mathematica.nb:  mathematica document for calculating
verification solution


USAGE EXAMPLE:

stc-22113s >> gfortran -o generate_test_data generate_test_data.f
stc-22113s >> gfortran -o rms_error rms_error.f
stc-22113s >> ./generate_test_data
stc-22113s >> ./rms_error
 numpts_b is       10001
 numpts is         801
 errornorm    2.1843926728509855
 normalized rms error =   0.60688268736536410
 error_max =   0.87194404462723563
